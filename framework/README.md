# StoryOS Universal Foundation — v3

A canon-discipline system, not a story. **Project-agnostic by design:** point it at any
long-running serialised project and it derives state, enforces the rules, and hands off
cleanly to a new AI. The Story Land 4 Fire Phoenix fic is the corpus it is currently wired to.

## Why this exists
Your old control centre *displayed* state. Displayed state can silently lie — and it did:
`CHAPTER_53_VALIDATION` said “Chapter53 is valid and ready” after the user rejected that
branch, and `SP526` / `Dawnflame 960` / `Dawn-Iron 2,480` were drift values a repair had
already removed. Here those are **enforced** by tooling, and the two traps are now marked.

## Layout
| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `AGENT_ONBOARDING.md` | **Read first.** Phase 0 gate, authority order, prohibitions |
| `foundation/STATUS_PANEL.md` | Live state (generated) |
| `foundation/NO_MISTAKE_LIVE_RULES.md` | Rules R01–R24, each traceable to a real failure |
| `foundation/PERFECT_CONTINUATION_SKILL.md` | The six gates + continuation algorithm |
| `foundation/CURRENT_STATE_MANIFEST.json` | Machine state, schema `storyos-manifest/3` |
| `foundation/canon/locks/*.card.md` | 41 lock cards, each citing its source receipt |
| `foundation/canon/characters/*.card.md` | 9 character cards, floor + ceiling |
| `foundation/BANNED_TOKENS.json` | Regression-token registry |
| `canon_coverage/CANON_LEDGER.md` | fic ↔ canon, per-chapter status |
| `canon_coverage/BRANCH_LEDGER.md` | active vs superseded branches |
| `tools/storyos_validate.py` | The gate: 9 checks, blocks drafting on error |
| `scripts/scan_project.py` | Rebuilds manifest + cards from any corpus |
| `scripts/gen_docs.py` | Renders the human docs from the manifest |
| `scripts/build_site.py` | Builds the control centre, embedding live gate status |
| `templates/` | Coverage, receipt, and new-project manifest skeletons |
| `site/index.html` | The dashboard (self-contained; `STATE.json` beside it) |

## One command
```bash
python3 scripts/scan_project.py <corpus_dir> . && python3 scripts/gen_docs.py \
 && python3 scripts/build_site.py . && python3 tools/storyos_validate.py --project . --phase full
```

## New project in 4 steps
```bash
cp -r tools scripts templates AGENT_ONBOARDING.md ../my-new-project/
cp templates/PROJECT_MANIFEST_TEMPLATE.json ../my-new-project/foundation/CURRENT_STATE_MANIFEST.json
# fill only what is true; leave blanks rather than guessing
python3 tools/storyos_validate.py --project ../my-new-project --phase pre
```
Then `python3 tools/storyos_validate.py --selftest` any time you doubt the guards.

## Invariants
1. **Nothing is hand-typed into state.** Numbers come from files, so state cannot drift from canon.
2. **A rule that cannot be checked is not enforced.** Hence gates, not prose.
3. **Missing is reported, not invented.** `UNKNOWN — needs source` beats a confident fabrication.
4. **Rejected work is quarantined, marked, and inert** — never deleted, never live.
5. **The dashboard is a mirror.** Authority order ends at `AGENT_ONBOARDING.md`.

# The growth engine (v4) — accumulates for life

Three layers, deliberately separated so nothing can be lost or overwritten:

| Layer | Where | Mutability |
|---|---|---|
| **Your projects** | `projects/<name>/` | **never written by StoryOS** |
| **Accumulated state** | `$STORYOS_HOME/projects/<name>/` | **append-only** |
| **Generated mirrors** | `$STORYOS_HOME/projects/<name>/state/` | rebuilt anytime, disposable |

```bash
export STORYOS_HOME=$HOME/storyos-home
storyos init
storyos use <project> --name <n> --label "..."   # register, as many as you like
storyos scan   --project <n>                     # re-derive state from the files
storyos gate   --project <n>                     # the pre-draft gate
storyos status --project <n>                     # gate + how much it has learned
storyos learn  --what "..." --rule "..." \       # a rejection becomes a PERMANENT lock
                --token SP526 --pattern "Rank\s*23/\s*SP\s*156"
storyos export --project <n> [--include-prose]   # handoff bundle for another agent
storyos serve  --port 4180                       # online, all projects
```

## Why it gets better with use
`storyos learn` does three things at once, and that is the whole trick:
1. appends to `decisions.jsonl` — **never edited, never deleted**;
2. writes a lock card so a human can read *why*;
3. feeds `tokens` + `enforce_regexes` straight into the validator, so the **next gate run fails**
   any prose that repeats the mistake. The system acquires a new reflex.

A rule you state once is prose someone skims. A rule you *learn* is code that blocks.

## History and going online
```bash
bash storyos/tools/self_commit.sh   # git-commits repo + snapshots the home; keeps every decision
bash storyos/tools/deploy.sh docker # Dockerfile + compose volume on any VPS (no DB, no lock-in)
bash storyos/tools/deploy.sh git    # version it off-box — PRIVATE remote, it holds unreleased chapters
```
All state is plain files under `$STORYOS_HOME`. Back that folder up and you own the system
forever — no database to migrate, no service that can die and take your canon with it.

## Handing to another agent
`storyos export` produces `AGENT_BRIEF.md` (binding learned rules + first three commands),
the append-only decision log, every lock card, the full derived state, and a copy of the
engine — so the receiving agent can run `--selftest` and *verify the checker itself* rather
than trusting it. Add `--include-prose` only when they must write the next chapter.
